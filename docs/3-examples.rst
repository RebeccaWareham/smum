Running a simple example
-------------------------

The following steps are required to construct a minimal simulation example.

1. Define model parameters.
2. We define a formula for the electricity model. This model will compute the
   electricity demand based on previously computed income levels.
3. We define a python dictionary to tell the function `run_calibrated_model`
   how to calibrate the model. The order of the models (i.e. dictionary keys) matter
   as the model will calibrate them in the specified order. In this case, we
   need to calibrate the income model first in order to calibrate the
   electricity model because the computation of electricity directly depends on
   the estimation of income.
4. We run the model with the defined parameters. The model with iterate until
   all models are calibrated.

.. code:: python

  # load libraries
  import pandas as pd
  from urbanmetabolism.population.model import run_calibrated_model

  # load model coefficients
  elec  = pd.read_csv('data/test_elec.csv',   index_col=0)
  inc   = pd.read_csv('data/test_inc.csv',    index_col=0)
  water = pd.read_csv('data/test_water.csv',  index_col=0)

  # define model, order matters
  model = {"Income":      {'table_model': inc },
           "Water":       {'table_model': water},
           "Electricity": {'table_model': elec}

  # run simulation
  run_calibrated_model(
      model,
      census_file = 'data/benchmarks_projected.csv',
      year = 2016)

This subsection describes the required steps to perform a simple simulation.
The steps to perform a simulation are two-fold:

1) The definition of a consumption model; and

2) The construction of scenarios

The definition of consumption models is required for the estimation of
consumption levels at a micro-level. The consumption models estimate resource
consumption intensities at an individual level based on predefined consumption
drivers. The consumption model implemented in the simulation can be any type of
resource demand model.

The definition of scenarios is performed at an aggregate level (simple
scenario) or at a micro-level (advanced scenario). The construction of simple
scenarios is performed by extrapolating the driver variables at an aggregated
level. An advanced scenario will update the consumption model itself for each
simulation year.

Consumption models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to explain the consumption of resources at a micro-level, the model
requires a defined consumption model. :numref:`tab_income` lists the input data passed to
the urban metabolism model, defining the model used for the estimation of
income. Income levels are subsequently used for the estimation of electricity
and water demand.

For the construction of a sample survey, the model requires a set of parameters
for each variable:

1. Mean value of variable coefficient `[co_mu]`

   This is the `mu` value (:math:`\mu` value) used to define a sampling probability distribution
   (normal distributed) for the variable coefficient.

   This coefficient indicates the effect that the variable has on income.

   If the variable is defined as categorical (see parameter `dis`) the model
   requires a `co_mu` value for each category.

   If the variable is defined as deterministic (see parameter `dis`) the model
   requires no `co_mu` value.

2. Standard deviation of variable coefficient `[co_sd]`

   The second parameter the model needs in order to define a normal distribution is the
   standard deviation of the sampling probability distribution.

   With the values of `co_mu` and `co_sd`, the model constructs a normal distribution.
   The model will take samples based on this distribution.

   If the variable is defined as categorical (see parameter `dis`) the model
   requires a `co_sd` value for each category.

   If the variable is defined as deterministic (see parameter `dis`) the model
   requires no `co_sd` value.

3. Probability value for dichotomous variables (single value) or categorical distributions (probability vector) `[p]`

   For dichotomous variables (yes/no, female/male, 1/0, etc.…) a single value
   is assigned to parameter `p`. Parameter `p` is the probability for the variable
   to take one of these values.

   The `p value` of the first row of  :numref:`tab_income`  is set to 0.19. This means that at
   simulation year 2010 the model will sample a household with a female head
   (male is the reference category) with a 19% probability.

   If the expected variable is categorical (high\middle/low, 1/2/3, etc.) the
   value assigned to parameter `p` is a vector with size equal to the number of
   categories.

4. Mean value of distribution `[mu]`

   This is the `mu` value (:math:`\mu` value) used to define a sampling probability distribution for
   the variable value.

   This parameter has to be defined for either continuous variables (normal
   distribution) of for discrete variables (poisson distribution).

5. Standard deviation for distribution `[sd]`

   For continuous distributed variables (normal distribution) the model needs to
   define a value for its standard deviation.

6. A distribution type `[dis]`

   This parameter defines the sampling probability distribution for the
   variable values. The Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo routine will use this
   distribution (define through parameters `mu` and `sd`) to sample the variable
   values.

   The variable coefficients are by default sampled along a normal
   distribution, defined by `co_mu` and `co_sd`.

7. An upper boundary `[ub]`

   An optional Upper Boundary defined by parameter `ub` can be imputed into the
   simulation model. This parameter will cap the sampled variable value at this
   value.

8. A lower boundary `[lb]`

   Identical to parameter `ub` but for the lower boundary of the sampled variable.

The defined income model estimates income levels at a household level. The
variables used for the estimation are:

1. Gender of the household head

   This variable defines the gender of the household head. The model assumes
   a 919.01 Philippine-Pesos increase in household income if the household head is female. The
   model will construct a synthetic sample where 20% of all household heads are
   female.

2. Urbanity

   Defines if the household is classified as urban or rural. The category
   “rural” is used as reference category. The coefficient describes a positive
   influence on income, urban households are attributed on average 7 105.22
   Philippine-Pesos with a standard deviation of 127.94 Pesos.

3. Family size

   The impact of family income by household size is an additional 1666.85 Pesos per
   additional family member.

4. Age of head of household

   The age of the household head is modelled as a continues variable. This is
   defined by setting the parameter `dis` to “Normal” (the normal distribution is
   a continuous distribution). The shape of the distribution is defined by
   variables `mu` and `sd`.

   The impact of household head age on income is defined by parameter `co_mu`, set
   to 116.58 with a standard deviation of 4.68 (via parameter `sd`).

5. The education level of head of household

   The education level of the household head also impacts the income level of
   the household. In this case, the model defines this variable as categorical.
   For each category the impact on income, relative to the reference level
   (Elementary School), has to be defined on parameter `co_mu`.

   The model will create a synthetic sample following these parameters. On
   a second step, the model calibrates the estimated income levels to a known
   income value i.e. the aggregated total income of the city.

   Prior income distribution and calibrate posterior distribution

:numref:`fig_income` shows the histogram of the original data used in the regression
model, required for the estimation of regression coefficients used on variable
`co_mu`, the known income level for 2016 (dotted green line) and the histogram of
the constructed sample survey income levels. The figure also shows the absolute
and specific error of the calibration. The estimated total income, i.e. the sum
of all households’ income in the synthetic sample survey differs by 0.01% from
the official total income of the city reported in 2016. This means that the
income estimation of the model has been calibrated properly. The computed
calibration `k-factor` is used for the estimation of income for all other
simulation years.

Following this schema, the model is able to compute all type of variables. In
this section, the model is implemented for the estimation of electricity
consumption levels as well as water consumption levels. The estimation of water
and electricity consumption makes use of previously estimated income levels for
their computation as well as demographic variables sampled for the estimation
of income levels.

   Estimated electricity distribution

:numref:`tab_elec` describes the implemented model for the estimation of electricity
demand. Analogues to the model defined for the estimation of income, the table
list a set of variables used for the estimation of electricity consumption.
These variables are described by their distribution (required for sampling
them) and their coefficients.

The variables used in this example for the estimation of electricity
consumption are the following:

1) AC

   This variable is one of the most important variables for the estimation of
   electricity consumption levels of individual households.

   This variable describes the use of Air Conditioning in the household for cooling purposes.

2) Cooking

   This variable describes the impact on electricity demand of using an electric device for cooking.

3) Lighting

   This variable indicates the use of electric energy for the lighting of the
   house. This variable is directly related to electrification rate. By 2016 it
   is assumed that 97% of all households use electric energy for the lighting
   of their houses in Sorsogon City, the Philippines.

4) Refrigeration

   This variable describes the use of electricity for refrigeration purposes. Similar to
   the lighting variable, the model assumes that by 2016 all households in the city use
   electric energy for refrigeration.

5) TV

   This variable describes the use of electricity for TV and other leisure
   electric equipment like radios, computers and mobile phones.

6) Urban

   Analogues to the income estimation, the urbanization of a household has an
   impact on its electricity consumption.

   For 2016 the model assumes an urbanization rate of 65%.

Similar to the estimation of income, the estimation electricity is calibrated
to the known city level electricity consumption level for the residential
sector. :numref:`fig_elec` shows the estimation error of the model by comparing
the calibrated estimated electricity consumption values from the synthetic
sample survey to the consumption values from the Household Energy Consumption
Survey HECS (PSA, 2004). The specific estimation error is close to zero with
a value of 1.83e-4% (0.000183%).
